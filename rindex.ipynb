    "## CSV Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The full name for this data format is \"comma-separated values\", but it is conventionally referred to by the shorthand \"CSV\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, this format is designed to contain tabular data (data represented by rows and columns), where each line of the file is a row, and each column of data within that row is separated by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is a **plain text**, **delimited** format, meaning its contents are essentially just strings with a specified structure. You can visually inspect the contents of plain text files using general-purpose text editing tools such as Vim, VS Code, or Notepad.  (This is in contrast to formats like images or SQLite databases, which contain encoded bytes that require specific tools to read.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we can start digging in to how the CSV *format* works without actually using any CSV *files*. Instead we'll just start with some Python strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have this dataset representing the 100 meter dash times for 4 high school athletes across 3 track meets:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Meet 1 | Meet 2 | Meet 3 |\n",

    "\n",
    "A data schema is, broadly, the structure that the data is stored in. As a part of the overall data science process, understanding the schema is an important element of **data understanding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes some things that can be determined automatically/programmatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many rows and columns are there?\n",
    "* What are the column names?\n",
    "* For a given column, what is the data type (e.g. string, integer, boolean)?\n",
    "* Is one of the columns a unique identifier for that record?\n",
    "* Which columns can contain missing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are other things that you might need additional documentation to determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does a row (record) represent?\n",
    "* What does each column (feature) represent?\n",
    "* For a numeric column, what are the units (e.g. seconds, inches, kilograms)?\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with database tools like SQL, the schema is a formal attribute of the system that can be inspected. In the SQLite command-line interface, for example, the command is `.schema`, which will tell you the names of all tables and the data types of each of their columns. There can also be formal schemas in NoSQL (not only SQL) databases as well as JSON and XML file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with CSV files, understanding the schema is more ambiguous and open-ended. It's about getting yourself oriented to the overall structure of the data, and filling in the finer details as needed for the business problem.\n",

    "### Data Schema of the Olympic Medals Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the Olympic medals dataset we've been working with as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possibly the most important question to ask about any CSV dataset is:** ***What does a row represent?***\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem extremely obvious but it can be important to make sure you understand the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this dataset, a row represents an Olympic medal win.\n",

    "It does *not* represent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A country (the same country can appear multiple times if it has won medals in multiple years)\n",
    "* A type of Olympic track and field event (the same event name can appear multiple times if it happened in multiple years)\n",
    "* An Olympic athlete (the same athlete can appear multiple times if they have won multiple medals, and some rows are team events where the name is `null`)\n",
    "* The performance (\"Result\") of a given athlete in a given event in a given year, if that performance did not win a medal\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore if you were trying to answer a question about a country, a type of event, or an athlete, you would need to perform some additional filtering and/or aggregation in order to form the correct units to answer that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were trying to answer a question about the performance of athletes who did not win medals vs. those who did win medals, that would not be possible with this dataset, since this dataset only includes medal winners. It also would not allow you to answer questions about the performance of these athletes at these events outside of the Olympics (e.g. at the national championship level).\n",

    "Understanding what a row represents is crucial for being able to identify what questions you can and cannot answer with a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does each column represent?**\n",
